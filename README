The initial position of the light is at (1,1,1) and it is assumed that the viewer is at (0,0,3)

A second texture can be added and the blending style between the first and the second texture can be selected.
The texture blending parameter only affects the "average" blending, which is a linear interpolation between two textures depending on that parameter.

For normal mapping, the second texture should be the normal mapping texture. 
It calculates the normals by adding the normals encoded in the texture and the object together for each vertex location.
The effect is only visible when light is enabled.
